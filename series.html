<p>Loki Laufeyson, known by adoption as Loki Odinson and by his title as the God of Mischief has generally been a villain in the MCU, variously attempting to conquer Asgard or Earth, and having allied himself with more powerful villains to achieve his aims. He has particular antagonism for his adoptive brother Thor, and is known to variously ally with and then betray Thor and others, and to regularly return from apparent death. In his development through the series, he becomes less of a supervillain and more of an antihero.</p>

<h2>RED SKULL</h2>
<center><img src = "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VbeNsFmx5xRth9RhniTKrA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTY0MDtoPTMzOQ--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/c292c2ab870d6b4110fe582581f4fe1f"></center>
<p>Johann Schmidt is the former head of HYDRA, the special weapons division of the Nazi Schutzstaffel and a modern-day incarnation of the ancient society. Having become a confidant of Adolf Hitler during World War II, Schmidt gained ambitions to become the superior man, leading him to use the prototype of Abraham Erskine's Super Soldier Serum on himself, resulting in him becoming disfigured with a red face, gaining the name Red Skull. While he led HYDRA, Red Skull had found the Tesseract which he had believed could help him to control the world. However, Red Skull's plans were challenged by the Allies' only super soldier, Captain America, who destroyed the HYDRA facilities. Once Red Skull had launched his offensive, intending to bring the United States down onto its knees, he was intercepted by Captain America. However, the fight ended when Red Skull touched the Tesseract with his bare hands, prompting it to create a wormhole and send him elsewhere. Red Skull was teleported to Vormir, where he became trapped in a state of purgatory, becoming a Stonekeeper, a wraith advising those who sought the Soul Stone. After seventy-three years on Vormir, Red Skull met Thanos and Gamora, as they sought the Soul Stone. Red Skull led them to it and disappeared after Thanos sacrificed Gamora as he claimed his prize. As Thanos had obtained the stone, Red Skull's curse was broken, and he was free to leave Vormir and pursue his own goals once more.</p>

<h2> MALEKITH THE ACCURSED </h2>
<center><img src = "https://cdn3.whatculture.com/images/2017/06/cdc9b83ccf7dcb50-600x338.jpg"></center>
<p>Malekith was the cruel and malevolent leader of the Dark Elves, a race of beings that thrived in primordial darkness before the Big Bang. Born in a realm of complete darkness, Malekith led his people in a war against the Asgardians, using an ancient weapon known as the Aether in an attempt to revert the universe to a state of complete darkness. Malekith was thought to have been wiped out with the rest of his race in the final battle against the Asgardian King Bor in 2988 B.C. during the Convergence. Malekith survived, however, and after millennia in prolonged hibernation, returned during the next Convergence 5,000 years later in 2013. Upon learning Jane Foster absorbed the Aether, Malekith and his armies invaded Asgard, before reclaiming it from Foster to complete his conquest. Before his attempt could succeed, however, Malekith and his armies were opposed by Bor's grandson, Thor, in the Battle of Greenwich. During their fight, Malekith was teleported across the Nine Realms back to Svartalfheim, where he was crushed by his own warship and died.</p>

<h2>RONAN</h2>

<p>Ronan was a radical Kree warlord and a former Accuser of the Kree Empire. A participant in the Kree-Skrull War, Ronan worked with Yon-Rogg and the Starforce after the Ambush in Torfa to wipe out the last of the Skrull refugees. Ronan and the Accusers were then called to drop warheads on Earth to wipe out the remaining Skrull opposition there, but were repelled when Captain Marvel came to Earth's defense. The Accusers retreated, with Ronan promising retribution. Further disgusted by an armistice made between the Kree and Nova Empires to end the Kree-Nova War, Ronan initiated a new campaign to eradicate the Xandarians by forging an alliance with Thanos, offering the Orb in exchange for the destruction of Xandar. After a long search, Ronan acquired the Orb, but after realizing it had housed the Power Stone, he instead betrayed Thanos and chose to take the Orb's power for himself. Using his new-found power, he and his forces attacked Xandar, only to be defeated and killed by the Guardians of the Galaxy.</p><br><hr>
<h2>ULTRON</h2>
<center><img src = "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/marveldatabase/images/a/a6/Ultron_%28Earth-199999%29_from_Avengers_Age_of_Ultron_001.png/revision/latest?cb=20150430180633"></center>
<p>Ultron was an artificial intelligence who was originally designed to be part of a peacekeeping program created by both Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, using the decrypted code derived from the Mind Stone encased within Loki's Scepter. However, when the Mind Stone activated him, Ultron's original programming directive, which was to protect Earth from all domestic and extraterrestrial threats, had swiftly become corrupted by the stone. Upon accessing the Internet and looking at the history of the human race, Ultron deemed humanity itself as the greatest threat to peace on Earth and attempted to commit extinction-level genocide against them, so that he and his Ultron Sentries would be the only being left active upon the Earth, also deeming the Avengers to be the greatest threat of all and making his mission to end them. </p><br><hr>
<h2>ZEMO</h2>
<center><img src = "https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/8e1a8599_e7ae_4835_bed4_97dc4236832f_1_201_a.jpeg"></center>
<p>Baron Helmut J. Zemo is a Sokovian nobleman, former Colonel of the Sokovian Armed Forces and commander of EKO Scorpion. Following the Battle of Sokovia, Zemo then became a criminal mastermind who sought revenge against the world's enhanced individuals, such as the Avengers after losing his family and became obsessed with destroying them. Knowing he was no match against the Avengers, Zemo planned to have them all destroy themselves, by framing the Winter Soldier for killing T'Chaka, which caused Captain America to defend Barnes from the world. His actions caused the Avengers Civil War, in which Iron Man led the manhunt for Barnes and Zemo, allowing Stark to learn Barnes was responsible for his parents' murder. With the Avengers in ruin, Zemo tried to shoot himself, but was captured by Black Panther and given to Joint Counter Terrorist Centre for his imprisonment. Eight years later, Zemo was broken out of prison by Barnes, to aid him and Sam Wilson in tracking down the Flag Smashers. Zemo agreed, as he intended to put an end to super soldiers for good. Zemo took Wilson and Barnes across Madripoor, where Zemo then met and killed Wilfred Nagel, the creator of the new serum. When Zemo found all of the Flag Smashers in Latvia, he destroyed all but one of their remaining serum vials. Zemo was then involved in the clash between John Walker and the Dora Milaje, as they both intended to take him into custody, during which Zemo quietly escaped. Zemo had visited the Sokovian Memorial, where he made amends with Barnes, before being handed to the Dora Milaje to continue his sentence within the Raft. Once Zemo remained in the Raft, Oeznik assassinated the three remaining Flag Smashers.</p><br><hr>
<h2>EGO</h2>

<p>Ego was a Celestial, a primordial and powerful being, and the biological father of Peter Quill and Mantis. A living planet with a humanoid extension of himself, Ego sought to find meaning in his life and, to achieve this end, planned to remake the entire universe via an omnicidal extinction-level event known as the Expansion, using "seeds" planted on various worlds to terraform them into new extensions of himself, thereby eradicating all other life in the universe but himself. This process required two Celestials, however, so Ego traveled across the universe, siring children on humanoid aliens everywhere he went in an attempt to produce a Celestial heir, eventually having thousands to millions of children. Ego hired the Yondu Ravager Clan to abduct and transport some of these offspring to his planet, though none of them proved to have inherited Celestial DNA, at which point Ego killed them. When Ego heard of a tale involving a man from Earth who held an Infinity Stone in his hand without dying, he realized this man must have been the son he sired with Meredith Quill, whom Udonta failed to deliver. Ego and Quill reunited for the first time in Berhert after saving the Guardians from hundreds of Sovereign fleet drones. Ego proceeded to take Quill and half of the Guardians to his planet. When Quill happened to successfully inherit the Celestial gene, Ego bonded with his biological son where he did finally proceeded of revealing his true colors, explaining his innate desire of remaking the universe by hypnotizing Quill into a trance to gain compliance. However, when Ego revealed he was responsible for his mother's death, Quill snapped out of his hypnosis and reunited with the Guardians, including his daughter Mantis, to kill Ego and thwart the Expansion from continuation, saving trillions of lives.</p>

However, as Spider-Man discovered Mysterio's deception, he defeated Beck in London, with Beck's overconfidence resulting in his own death.

Despite swearing off violence to raise his family, Wenwu eventually reclaimed his rings when Ying Li was murdered at the hands of the Iron Gang. He trained Shang-Chi to be an assassin to avenge his wife's murder. However, Wenwu's two children would grow fearful of their father and eventually abandon him. In the 21st Century, Wenwu discovered that Aldrich Killian was able to recruit Trevor Slattery to impersonate Wenwu himself, giving him the Mandarin moniker, while also appropriating the legend of the Ten Rings. Enraged at Slattery's portrayal of him, Wenwu had him abducted and sentenced to imprisonment for tarnishing his name. Eventually, Wenwu would begin hearing his late wife's voice, urging him to free her from imprisonment in Ta Lo. Wenwu sought out his children to aid him, only for Shang-Chi and Xu Xialing to reject his request, siding with Ying Nan to stop his army. Through his attempts to rescue his wife, Wenwu unintentionally unleashed the Dweller-in-Darkness.

<p>Nathaniel Richards was a variant of Nathaniel Richards who sought to conquer as many worlds as possible under the name Kang the Conqueror. He joined the Council of Kangs. Deeming that the council's actions would lead to the end of the Multiverse, Richards attempted to fight them. However, the council decided to banish him to the Quantum Realm, where he allied with Janet van Dyne to rebuild his Time Chair, until he was betrayed after van Dyne discovered his evil plans. Kang was once again trapped in the Quantum Realm, using that time to conquer part of it and built an empire in Axia. Years later, after taking Darren Cross under his wing, Kang had ordered the capture of Ant-Man and Cassie Lang, holding the latter prisoner unless Ant-Man would succeed in claiming the Multiversal Engine Core to escape the Realm with his new empire and enact a new dynasty. However, Kang's attempts were thwarted by a revolution by the Freedom Fighters. In his last opportunity to escape, he had a brutal duel against Ant-Man, which resulted in Kang being shrunken and decimated by his own Engine Core, though his death would inadvertently alert the Council of Kangs about the Avengers learning about the Multiverse, prompting them to take their own measures.</p>
