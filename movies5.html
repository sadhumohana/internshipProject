<h2>ANT-MAN AND THE WASP: QUANTAMANIA</h2>
<center><img src = "https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/g_antmanquantumania_6_1006_a8b027c4.jpeg?region=1%2C0%2C1298%2C730" width = "649px" height = "365px"></center>
<p>Ant-Man and the Wasp find themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that pushes them beyond the limits of what they thought was possible. Scott and Cassie are found by natives who are rebelling against their ruler, while Hope, Janet, and Pym explore a sprawling city to get answers. Hope, Janet, and Pym meet with Lord Krylar, a former ally of Janet's, who reveals that things have changed since she left, and that he is now working for Kang, the Quantum Realm's new ruler. The three are forced to flee and steal Krylar's ship. The Langs, meanwhile, are told by rebel leader Jentorra that Janet's involvement with Kang is indirectly responsible for his rise to power. The rebels soon come under attack by Kang's forces led by M.O.D.O.K., who is revealed to be Darren Cross, having survived his apparent death at the hands of Scott. The Langs are taken to Kang, who demands that Scott helps get his power core back or else he will kill Cassie. Scott is then taken to the core's location and shrinks down. The core causes him to split into multiple copies of himself, who nearly overwhelm him, but Hope arrives and helps him acquire the power core. However, Kang reneges on the deal, capturing Janet with M.O.D.O.K. destroying her ship with Hank on it. After being rescued by his ants, who were also pulled into the Quantum Realm, rapidly evolved, and became hyper-intelligent, Pym helps Scott and Hope as they make their way to Kang. Cassie rescues Jentorra and they commence an uprising against Kang and his army. During the fight, Cassie convinces Cross to switch sides and fight Kang, though he sacrifices his life. Janet fixes the power core as she, Pym, Hope, and Cassie jump through a portal home, but Kang attacks Scott. Before he can beat Scott into submission, Hope returns, and she and Scott throw Kang and the Pym Particles into the power core, destroying them both. Cassie reopens the portal for Scott and Hope to return home.</p>

<h2>GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL.3</h2>
<center><img src = "https://technext24.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-89.png" width = "800px" height = "497px"></center>
<p>Still reeling from the loss of Gamora, Peter Quill must rally his team to defend the universe and protect one of their own. If the mission is not completely successful, it could possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them. In the aftermath, Quill decides to leave the Guardians, naming Rocket as captain; Quill travels to Earth to reunite with his grandfather, Jason. Mantis embarks on a journey of self-discovery with the Abilisks, Gamora reunites with the Ravagers, and Nebula and Drax remain on Knowhere to raise the rescued children. The new Guardians, consisting of Rocket, Groot, Kraglin, Cosmo, Adam, Phyla (one of the rescued children), and Adam's pet Blurp, take on a new mission.</p>
